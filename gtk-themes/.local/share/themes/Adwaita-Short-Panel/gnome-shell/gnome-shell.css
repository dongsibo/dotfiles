/*
 * Change height of GNOME 40 panel.
 *
 * GNOME 40 now indicates focus in the panel using a "pill-shaped background"
 * [1]. Unfortunately, this change also increases the height of the panel from
 * 1.86em to 2.2em, which can mess up the text height alignment in GNOME
 * Terminal. The panel height can only be changed with a new theme (as
 * opposed to a CSS setting in a gtk.css file), so this skeleton theme,
 * "Adwaita-Short-Panel" serves the purpose of reverting the panel height back
 * to 1.86em.
