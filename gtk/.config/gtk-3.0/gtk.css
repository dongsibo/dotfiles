/*
 * Decrease the tabs bar height in gnome-terminal.
 *
 * Adapted from:
 * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36869701/decrease-the-tabs-bar-height-in-gnome-terminal
 *
 * Make gnome-terminal screen height a perfect multiple of font height (1.15
 * font scaling system-wide, Terminus Regular (TTF) 12 and 1.15x1.15 cell
 * spacing) so that there is no wasted space. TTF is needed instead of the
 * original bitmap font because the font library for many GTK apps, pango,
 * dropped support for bitmap fonts in version 1.44.x (not sure why this isn't
 * a major release since it breaks backwards compatibility).
 *
 * If using terminus-font-otb (like from Arch Linux's community repo), then
 * just use normal cell spacing and size 13 font like before (Terminus Medium
 * 13). Harfbuzz currently supports OpenType bitmap fonts (which is the shaping
 * engine that pango uses).
 *
 * Involves reducing height of the tab header bar. You can also check for pixel
 * perfect alignment by highlighting near the bottom edge to see if you can see
 * the top of the highlight on the line following the bottom line.
