 * Make gnome-terminal screen height a perfect multiple of font height (1.15
 * font scaling system-wide, Terminus 13, and normal cell spacing) so that
 * there is no wasted space.
 *
 * Involves reducing height of the tab header bar. You can also check for pixel
 * perfect alignment by highlighting near the bottom edge to see if you can see
 * the top of the highlight on the line following the bottom line.
